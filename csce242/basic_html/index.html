    <h2>What is F1?</h2>
    <p>
        Formula One (abbreviated F1) is a car race dating back all the way to the 1950s. Teams of two drivers race at speeds of
        over 220 MPH in races called a Grand Prix. A season consists of 22 races spread worldwide and includes some of the most
        famous tracks in racing history. There are 10 teams on the grid, meaning only 20 racers enter a Grand Prix. These teams
        battle it out to gain points with the goal of winning the Constructors Championship. Each racer also works to gain
        individual points to win the Drivers Championship. Racers and teams win points by their placement in a Grand Prix,
        winning the fastest lap of the race, or through sprint races. Every point in Formula One matters a lot. If a racer
        misses a race, they risk their opponents and rivals getting points and taking the lead over them in the championship.
